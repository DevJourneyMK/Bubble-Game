# Bubble-Game
I've been working on this interactive Bubble Game that I created using JavaScript, HTML, and a bit of CSS! 🟢✨

In this game:

1- You click the "Start" button to begin, and bubbles with random numbers appear on the screen.
2- You get a Hit Number, and your goal is to pop bubbles matching that number to earn points. 🎯
3- You have 30 seconds to get as many points as possible before the timer runs out! ⏱️
